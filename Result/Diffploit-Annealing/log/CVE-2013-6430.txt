You are given a Java error log when executing 'mvn test' in a project with dependency version 1.2.1:org.springframework:spring-web.
This test file compiles and runs successfully with version 1.2.

Your task is to:
1. Analyze why this issue occurs with the *1.2* but not with the *1.2.1 version*.
2. Consider how to resolve the issue **without updating this library**.
3. Determine and output the location in the project that should be modified to fix the problem.

Please return 'pom' if the fix is in the pom.xml file, or 'test' if the fix is in the test code.
Do not return any other text, just 'pom' or 'test'.
